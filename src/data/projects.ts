What It Is
A modular BPMS + ERP stack that unifies core operations (Inventory, HR/Attendance, Finance) with a workflow engine (BPMN) for approvals, SLAs, and auditable processes. Designed for staged rollout, multi-tenant setups, and real-time dashboards.

---

 Core Modules
- Inventory & Stock ‚Äî SKUs, batches, locations, QR/Barcode moves, cycle counts  
- HR & Attendance ‚Äî shifts, leave, timesheets, biometric/device integrations  
- Finance & Billing ‚Äî invoices, payments, cost centers, export to accounting  
- Procurement & Sales ‚Äî RFQs/POs/SOs, vendor/customer management  
- Workflow (BPMS) ‚Äî BPMN-driven approvals, tasks, escalations, SLAs, audit trail  
- Reporting ‚Äî KPI dashboards, PDF/Excel exports, scheduled emails/webhooks

---

 Architecture
- Frontend: Next.js (App Router), React 18, TypeScript, Tailwind, PWA, SSR/SSG/ISR  
- Backend: Node.js + NestJS/Fastify (typed DTOs, DI, modular), REST/GraphQL/tRPC  
- Workflow/BPMS: Camunda/Zeebe or Temporal for long-running, reliable workflows  
- Data: PostgreSQL (+ Prisma), Redis (cache/locks/queues), S3-compatible object storage  
- Messaging/Jobs: BullMQ (job queues), Redis Streams / Kafka for event pipelines  
- Realtime: WebSocket/SSE channels for live tables, notifications, approvals  
- Auth & Security: Auth.js/Keycloak (OIDC), RBAC/ABAC, JWT rotation, per-tenant scoping  
- Files & Docs: S3 uploads, server-side PDF generation, signed URLs  
- Observability: OpenTelemetry traces, Sentry (errors), Prometheus + Grafana (metrics)  
- DevOps: Dockerized services, GitHub Actions CI/CD, preview deploys, zero-downtime releases  
- Edge & Delivery: Vercel/Cloudflare for global routing, CDN, image optimization

---

 QR/Barcode & Devices
- QR/Barcode for stock moves, picking/packing, asset tags  
- Web Scanner (ZXing/jsQR) on mobile PWA ‚Äî no native app needed  
- Label Printing (ZPL/PDF) with batch templates and reprint history

---

 AI-Assist (Optional)
- LLM copilots for search (‚Äúfind POs awaiting approval‚Äù), anomaly hints, and summaries  
- RAG on your operational data for natural-language analytics  
- Agents that propose next steps (e.g., auto-creating a replenishment PO)

---

 Governance & Compliance
- Multi-tenant isolation, row-level security patterns  
- Audit trails, signature logs, immutable event history  
- Data retention policies, backup/restore runs, DR plans

---

 Why It Wins
- Incremental rollout (module by module) with zero vendor lock-in  
- Visible ROI ‚Äî faster approvals, fewer errors, real-time stock truth  
- Admin-friendly ‚Äî schema-driven forms, role-based views, self-serve reports
